# Single Podcasts Web Application - Client Side (MVP)
(School project - Javautveckling, Jönköping University)

This repository contains the client-side application for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a single podcast web application. The client is primarily written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a focus on dynamic content manipulation using JavaScript. It interacts with the server-side application available at [https://github.com/Lovexd16/inlamning1grupp5](https://github.com/Lovexd16/inlamning1grupp5).

- **Guest Access:** Guests can browse and purchase content without the need for registration.
- **Dynamic Content Manipulation:** The application dynamically updates content based on user interactions and preferences using JavaScript.
- **Payment Handling:** Payments for purchases and subscriptions are securely processed through Stripe integration.
